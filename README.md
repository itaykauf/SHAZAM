SHAZAM - SHOOT AND ZAP ALIEN MONSTERS
=====================================

STORY
-----
You are captain of the Anti Chroma Cubist Colony (ACCC). The ACCC is a group of cubes who live a simple life harvesting the many shades of the grayscale. However, a recent infestation from the  Iridescence Turtle Task Team (ITTT) has caused a ruckus among the ACCC. You, as the captain, must vanquish the ITTT in your sector by using your dechromafication wand or the ACCC may mutiny against you! Good Luck!
